About
Hey there! Thank you for visiting my website!

I am currently pursuing an undergraduate degree in EECS at UC Berkeley. I am a 
competitive programmer and a full-stack developer. I am especially interested in 
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. 

Aside from technology, I am also passionate about music (being a pianist and trombonist),
tennis, and photography. Contact me by email if you have something exciting to share with me; 
I promise that I am an interesting person!
